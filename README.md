# 🐶 Virtual Pet Care

Welcome to **Virtual Pet Care**, a simple Java-based game where you take care of your own digital pet! Feed it, play with it, and make sure it stays happy and healthy. Built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, this project is designed for learning and experimenting with Java OOP concepts in a fun, interactive way.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This project allows users to:
- Create and name a virtual pet
- Monitor its status (hunger, energy, happiness)
- Interact with the pet through various actions (feeding, playing, resting)
- See how different actions affect the pet's well-being
